**Skeletonization**"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"zQXsNhtS7FmO"},"source":["\n","Skeletonization is a process used to reduce binary shapes to a skeletal remnant that largely preserves the extent and connectivity of the original shape while throwing away most of the original foreground pixels. There are several types and methods of skeletonization, each with its own characteristics and use cases. Below are some of the commonly used types and methods:\n","\n","1. Thinning:\n","Zhang-Suen Algorithm: A classical thinning algorithm that iteratively removes border pixels.\n","Guo-Hall Algorithm: Another iterative thinning algorithm with a different set of conditions for pixel removal.\n","2. Distance Transform + Peak Detection:\n","In this method, the distance transform of the binary image is computed first. Then, the skeleton is obtained by detecting the ridges or peaks in the distance map.\n","3. Voronoi Skeleton:\n","The Voronoi diagram of the background pixels is computed, and the skeleton is formed by the points that are equidistant to two or more nearest background pixels.\n","4. Medial Axis Transform:\n","This is similar to the distance transform method but specifically finds the medial axis of the shape, which is a set of all points having more than one closest point on the object’s boundary.\n","5. Topological Skeleton:\n","This method ensures that the topology of the original shape is preserved, making it useful for shape analysis and recognition.\n","6. Morphological Skeleton:\n","This method uses morphological operations (erosion and opening) to iteratively thin the binary image until the skeleton remains.\n","7. Ridge-based Methods:\n","These methods detect the ridges in the intensity image or the gradient magnitude image to find the skeleton.\n","8. Hamilton-Jacobi Skeleton:\n","This method uses the solutions of the Hamilton-Jacobi equations to compute the skeleton.\n","Each of these methods has its own advantages and disadvantages, and the choice of method depends on the specific requirements of the application. Some methods may preserve the topology better, while others may be faster or more robust to noise. It is often useful to experiment with different methods to find the one that works best for your particular use
